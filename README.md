A website about exploring the moons of Jupiter.

This was made on Khan Academy but because I wanted to add better content and images I made
another version of it off of Khan Academy. However this has some very bad CSS in it and I should
go and rework it to make the web design a bit smoother to edit, as it is very hard to tell
what specificity is overriding what at this poin and it makes altering the CSS slightly
unpredictable.
